By default, HN Tab is set to show the latest trending stories from the YCombinator Hacker News site. The app is powered by the [Angolia HN API](https://hn.algolia.com/api) and is inspired by [Githunt](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/githunt).

## Installation

Hacker News Tab doesn't require any setup. Here are the steps to install the extension:

1. Download or clone the repository.

2. Go into [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and enable Developer Mode.
